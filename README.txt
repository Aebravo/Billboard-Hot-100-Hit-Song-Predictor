Please make sure to change the file paths to your own when running the code. I have included a Latex PDF of a Jupyter Notebook titled "Billboard Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM.pdf" with all of the code and its outputs. The "billboard_decision_tree.png" is an output of the code. I have also included the raw script in a file titled "FinalProjectPythonCode.py".
