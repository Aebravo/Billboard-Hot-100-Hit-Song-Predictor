# Billboard Song Hit Predictor

The purpose of this project is to fit machine learning models to Spotify data in order to predict if a song will be a billboard hit or not.

Please make sure to change the file paths to your own when running the code. I have included a Latex PDF of a Jupyter Notebook titled "Billboard Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM.pdf" with all of the code and its outputs. The "billboard_decision_tree.png" is an output of the code. I have also included the raw script in a file titled "FinalProjectPythonCode.py". The original billboard songscores files was too large to upload to github, so I uploaded a random sample of rows from the table titled "billboard_songscores_sample.csv". Please use this in replacement to the "billboard_songscores.csv" which is read in the pandas dataframe for the python code.
